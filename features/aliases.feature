Feature: Time aliases

  Background:
    Given I send and accept JSON
    And there is a metric in the database with the name "membership-coverage"
    And it has a time of "2013-12-25T15:00:00+00:00"
    And it has a value of:
      """
      {"health":0.34,"telecoms":0.34,"energy":0.34}
      """
    And there is a metric in the database with the name "membership-coverage"
    And it has a time of "2013-12-24T15:00:00+00:00"
    And it has a value of:
      """
      {"health":0.33,"telecoms":0.33,"energy":0.33}
      """
    And there is a metric in the database with the name "membership-coverage"
    And it has a time of "2013-11-24T15:00:00+00:00"
    And it has a value of:
      """
      {"health":0.33,"telecoms":0.33,"energy":0.33}
      """

    Scenario: Using `all` alias
      When I send a GET request to "metrics/membership-coverage/all"
      Then the response status should be "200"
      And the JSON response should have "$.count" with the text "3"
