## Demo

You can see a demo version with some pre-prepared metrics at [https://demo.bothan.io](https://demo.bothan.io).

We've also put some of the demo metrics in a [Jekyll-powered dashboard](http://dashboards.bothan.io/). You can [check out the source on Github here](https://github.com/theodi/bothan-dashboards).

To add your own metrics, follow the steps in the [documentation](#documentation), using the username `username` and the password `password`. The database is reset every day at 7am UTC.
