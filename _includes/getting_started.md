Like the [spies in Return of the Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQeabed9N9M), Bothan brings you information.

It's a simple platform for storing and publishing metrics, both as JSON, and as simple, embeddable visualisations, which you can embded standalone in webpages, or use in [dashboards](http://dashboards.bothan.io/). Take a look at the [demo](#demo), or [read the docs](#documenation)

## Getting started

Getting started with Bothan is really simple. Simply click the button below to deploy your own free
Bothan instance to Heroku (requires a free Heroku account, but you'll be walked through the process if you don't).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftheodi%2Fbothan)

Your instance will come with a free [mLab](https://mlab.com/) sandbox database, enough to store around 500,000 metrics. This can be upgraded any time via Heroku.
